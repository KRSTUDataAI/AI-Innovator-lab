AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	It's stunning to realize that their attempts to do so are the most emotionally affecting things in the whole of the perfectly-named Infinity War: people valiantly, desperately trying to evoke humanity in the midst of a machine that makes that impossible.	50	negative	attempts, things, Infinity War, people, humanity, midst, machine
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	In some sense, this is every Marvel movie combined. So if the first installment of the two-part culmination of all that effort seems a bit loaded, I'd say other critics need to put their nitpicky hats away. This is for the fans, and they have earned it.	70	neutral	Marvel movie, first installment, two-part culmination, other critics, nitpicky hats, sense, effort, fans
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	If some pacing issues and the occasional bloat prevent it from quite reaching the upper echelons of the MCU, there's still more than enough here to keep viewers sated, saturated, and salivating over what's certain to be a poignant and potent Part Deux.	75	positive	potent Part Deux, pacing issues, occasional bloat, upper echelons, MCU, viewers, poignant
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	Maybe the quips and the punch-ups are there because they have to be, what with the film's steady parade of failure and even death. Plans fail. Character fails. Even sacrifices fail. It's not exactly refreshing, but it is bracing, and even gratifying.	40	negative	steady parade, quips, punch-ups, film, failure, death, Plans, Character, sacrifices
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	The Marvel Cinematic Universe's newest entry is its biggest, most ambitious piece of storytelling in the studio's 10 years of existence and the minute you exit the theatre, you'll be lining up at the box office to buy another ticket.

AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	Marvel has set an amazing stage for Avengers: Infinity War, and my only real question walking into the theater was, How can they possibly bring all of this together in a way that works as an actual movie? You'll be shocked how well they pull it off.	90	positive	amazing stage, real question, actual movie, Marvel, Avengers, Infinity War, theater, way
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	There is a fissure between critics and audiences, which I can admit. The movie is critic-proof. 'Avengers: Infinity War' is superhero porn, strictly for the fans, while 'Black Panther' was undeniably excellent, transcending the comic book fan base.	74	negative	comic book fan base, superhero porn, Black Panther, fissure, critics, audiences, movie, Avengers, Infinity War, fans
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	Avengers: Infinity War will chew you up, spit you out, and leave you a shell of a fan in the best way possible.

AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	Just when it looks as if all hope is smothered under the heavy weight of fan expectations [and] a reported $300 million budget, it comes roaring to life with a wake-'em-up battle on the fields of Wakanda and a quietly spectacular, sobering ending.	60	positive	spectacular, sobering ending, heavy weight, fan expectations, $300 million budget, hope, life, wake, battle, fields, Wakanda
AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR	Only now could the MCU arrive at a place where bluffs can be irrefutably called and gauntlets, real or metaphorical, can be thrown down. With audacity and thoughtfulness, Infinity War upends the comparative breeziness of all that came before it.	90	negative	comparative breeziness, MCU, place, bluffs, audacity, thoughtfulness, Infinity War
1917	Two of this film's biggest strengths are Newman's score and MacKay's commanding central performance, as well as the visual spectacle. 1917 has done an amazing job at taking a war from 100 years ago and turning it into an urgent, immersive experience.	90	positive	commanding central performance, urgent, immersive experience, biggest strengths, visual spectacle, amazing job, film, Newman, score, MacKay, war
1917	Sam Mendes' 1917 is a remarkable technical achievement, utilizing brilliant direction, cinematography, editing, visual effects, production design, and sound design, to tell a spellbinding tale that easily ranks as one of the very best films of 2019.	90	positive	remarkable technical achievement, Sam Mendes, brilliant direction, visual effects, production design, sound design, spellbinding tale, best films, cinematography, editing
1917	Rather empty spectacle; it doesn't really have characters, relationships or emotional stakes ... Schofield has few attributes, other than being a Very Decent British Man, and the film has little to say, other than that British Men are Very Decent.	60	negative	Very Decent British Man, Rather empty spectacle, British Men, emotional stakes, characters, relationships, Schofield, attributes, film
1917	Asking director Sam Mendes's latest film to prevent World War III seems like maybe a bit much, but here we are... Short of dropping average Americans into a war zone, nothing can drive home this unique brand of horror quite as much as movies can.	94	neutral	director Sam Mendes, World War III, war zone, latest film, average Americans, unique brand, horror, movies
1917	In one of the best war films of all time, director Sam Mendes brilliantly delivers a story of two WWI soldiers on a mission that's a stunning technical accomplishment that unfurls as one single take - and a deeply felt tale of heroism under fire.	90	positive	best war films, director Sam Mendes, two WWI soldiers, stunning technical accomplishment, one single take, time, story, mission, tale, heroism, fire
1917	[L]egendary cinematographer Roger Deakins (No Country for Old Men, Fargo, Blade Runner 2049) effectively drops the viewer in the center of the story and compels them to stay there, fully immersed in every muddy step, hunger pang, and rifle click.	89	neutral	No Country, Old Men, Blade Runner, muddy step, hunger pang, Fargo, viewer, center, story, rifle
1917	A soldier asks: Do you know where we are? Keeping with the Grand Theft Auto: Écoust-Saint-Mein aesthetic, you can guess which rock-song retort rolls through your mind. Full of empty razzle-dazzle, 1917 has as many dimensions as noticeable cuts.	30	neutral	Grand Theft Auto, Écoust-Saint-Mein aesthetic, rock-song retort, empty razzle-dazzle, many dimensions, noticeable cuts, soldier, mind
1917	The film has many standout moments, but Mendes' decision to film this...as a virtual one take à la Birdman turns his movie into a videogame where our heroes move forward across a varying landscape stopping for episodic incidents to unfold.	69	neutral	many standout moments, Mendes' decision, virtual one, varying landscape, episodic incidents, film, Birdman, movie, videogame, heroes
1917	In addition to Deakins, production designer Dennis Gassner and composer Thomas Newman also add layers of bravura artistry to create an experience that will leave you breathless, heart pounding and absolutely emotionally wrecked by the end.	100	neutral	production designer Dennis Gassner, composer Thomas Newman, bravura artistry, addition, Deakins, layers, experience, end
A STAR IS BORN	Cooper obviously overlooks a potential jackpot in a co-star eager to prove she's not just another poker face. Despite those restraints, she's ultimately his savior, displaying enough moxie and heart to engage, even when the movie fails to match the hype .	74	negative	potential jackpot, poker face, enough moxie, Cooper, star, restraints, savior, heart, movie, hype
A STAR IS BORN	Everything feels comfortably familiar, yet halfway through this plate of pleasing nostalgia and orchestrated pathos, you realize there's not much substance between the focaccia. We may love our two leads but their characters never feel entirely developed.	60	negative	two leads, Everything, plate, nostalgia, pathos, substance, focaccia, characters
A STAR IS BORN	Having already established himself as one of the best actors of his day, Cooper outdoes himself here, performing additional roles behind the scenes. None of his tasks are given short shrift, and his casting of Lady Gaga leads to an inspired performance.	70	neutral	best actors, additional roles, short shrift, Lady Gaga, inspired performance, day, Cooper, scenes, None, tasks, casting
A STAR IS BORN	Credit to Cooper for delivering his best, most soulful performance while pulling double duty behind the camera, but it's his co-star whose magnetism most draws you into their world - and keeps you there even when the film hits the occasional wrong note.	79	positive	best, most soulful performance, occasional wrong note, double duty, Credit, Cooper, camera, star, magnetism, world, film
A STAR IS BORN	Their chemistry is undeniable, their duets infectious and moving the action into the contemporary music scene, where Ally is rapidly reconfigured as a sequin-studded red head flanked by unnecessary dancers, strikes a long line of emotional notes.	100	positive	contemporary music scene, sequin-studded red head, unnecessary dancers, long line, emotional notes, chemistry, duets, action, Ally
A STAR IS BORN	It's a film that's wise to what it means to be famous in 2018 as well as old-fashioned movie entertainment, with gangbusters musical numbers and an effective and appealing love story between its two leads. And it will make Lady Gaga a movie star.	87	positive	gangbusters musical numbers, appealing love story, old-fashioned movie entertainment, movie star, two leads, Lady Gaga, film, effective
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	Turns out there is a plot device more annoying than time travel - quantum. But the make-it-up-as-we-go-along story aside, Reed still has a flair for using toys at his disposal - glitchy shrinking/growing devices, sight gags, Scott's giant ant pals, etc.	79	negative	glitchy shrinking/growing devices, giant ant pals, plot device, time travel, sight gags, quantum, Reed, flair, toys, disposal, Scott
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	Would be okay and maybe even fun were it not for the frequent presence of a gruesome ghost haunting the proceedings: a woman in constant physical and emotional agony who is trying desperately not to die. A weirdly disturbing fly in the amiable ointment.	20	negative	frequent presence, gruesome ghost, constant physical, emotional agony, disturbing fly, amiable ointment, proceedings, woman
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	But for the most part, the two hours you'll spend running around with Marvel's Ant pals is fun and doesn't have the same emotional investment Infinity War or even Black Panther did earlier this year. And, for once in the MCU, that's kind of refreshing.	75	negative	same emotional investment, most part, two hours, Ant pals, Black Panther, Marvel, Infinity War, MCU
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	An engaging superhero film that will genuinely appeal to both adults and children. Not knuckle-whiteningly exciting, but the humour perfectly undercuts the typical blockbuster dialogue whenever it threatens to fall into sentimentality or cod-physics.	70	positive	engaging superhero film, typical blockbuster dialogue, adults, children, humour, sentimentality, physics
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	Si la única razón de la existencia de esta secuela es para que Marvel pueda jactarse de tener otra heroína en sus filas, fácilmente esperábamos Capitana Marvel y así nos ahorrábamos dos de las horas más banales que el MCU nos ha ofrecido hasta ahora.	60	negative	única razón, otra heroína, Capitana Marvel, existencia, secuela, filas, horas, banales, MCU
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	Although the sequel's script isn't as clever as its forerunner and depends too much on bumbling slapstick, Ant-Man and the Wasp is often laugh-out-loud hilarious, while still giving the story the requisite emotional heft and action sequences.	75	negative	requisite emotional heft, bumbling slapstick, action sequences, sequel, script, forerunner, Ant-Man, Wasp, story
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	There's a lot going on here, which leads to a whole lot of gassy exposition to explain it all, including two separate scenes in which two different groups of good guys are tied to chairs while villains bloviate on the intricacies of the plot.	50	negative	two separate scenes, two different groups, gassy exposition, good guys, lot, chairs, villains, intricacies
ANT-MAN AND THE WASP	[The movie] makes us feel small and gives us the thrill of what it would feel like to be that tiny. It's a cartoon take on Gulliver's Travels - which is the delicious gimmick at the heart of the Ant-Man franchise... and impossible to resist.	70	negative	cartoon take, delicious gimmick, Ant-Man franchise, movie, thrill, Gulliver, Travels, heart
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	You will come for the characters & Story, get caught up in their journey, get excited about the action & leave with uncontained satisfaction. A laugh, a tear a cheer. A cinematic Marvel & the crown jewel of the Universe. A Must See! four out of 4 reels	100	positive	uncontained satisfaction, cinematic Marvel, crown jewel, characters, Story, journey, laugh, tear, cheer, Universe, 4 reels
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	Predictable and...overstuffed with snarky lines and bathetic moments, though as sumptuously made as anything to have rolled off the Marvel assembly line [but] since it gives series fans a heaping helping of what they obviously savor, they'll eat it up.	69	neutral	Marvel assembly line, snarky lines, bathetic moments, series fans, heaping helping
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	Frigga has one of the funniest lines in the whole movie: Son, eat more vegetables. Indeed, it is not terrible eat junk food from time to time, but we must eat healthier. The same goes for cinema. Endgame is junk food. The healthier cinema is elsewhere.	25	positive	funniest lines, junk food, healthier cinema, Frigga, movie, Son, vegetables, time, Endgame
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	Endgame is good, rollicking fun, entertaining to the last drop with dollops of humour and comic-book pathos. That said, it's no soul-shaking masterpiece. Along with it likely being the biggest film of the year Endgame might also be the most overrated.	50	positive	last drop, comic-book pathos, soul-shaking masterpiece, biggest film, Endgame, fun, dollops, humour, year
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	Is it the best superhero movie ever made? In the words of Balki Bartokomous, Don't be ridiculous. (The plotholes are prominent enough to make me consider dropping the rating a half-star.) Nevertheless, this ranks among the upper echelons of the MCU.	87	neutral	best superhero movie, Balki Bartokomous, upper echelons, words, plotholes, rating, half-star, MCU
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	Naysayers suggest that Marvel dominance of this cinematic age will one day feel goofy. That opinion is insane. A generation has grown up with these films as their cultural spinal column. They will no more outgrow them than our bodies shed vertebrae.	89	negative	cultural spinal column, Marvel dominance, cinematic age, Naysayers, opinion, generation, films, bodies, vertebrae
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	The MCU pictures have always stressed that neither the destination nor the journey are as important as the connections we make along the way. As this is already the most lucrative series ever, clearly that message has struck a chord with millions.	90	neutral	The MCU pictures, lucrative series, destination, journey, connections, way, message, chord, millions
AVENGERS: ENDGAME	The franchise has its ups and downs; the first Avengers film is certainly a highlight. But the sequels have the wisecracking-superteam formula on lockdown. They always deliver everything fans could hope for - except maybe any genuine surprise.	60	neutral	first Avengers film, wisecracking-superteam formula, genuine surprise, franchise, ups, downs, highlight, sequels, lockdown, everything, fans
BLACK PANTHER	What's honestly amazing about this film is that I'm not thinking about the action, the cool epic moments...I'm thinking about the things that shape these characters into who they become...I have to commend Black Panther, but it's not a film without flaws.	84	positive	cool epic moments, Black Panther, film, action, things, characters, flaws
BLACK PANTHER	As a superhero film Black Panther is fine entertainment that dutifully hits all the beats it is supposed to. Beyond that, anyone willing to decode the film as some sort of sophisticated allegory about black rights might find themselves tied up in knots.	60	positive	Black Panther, fine entertainment, sophisticated allegory, black rights, superhero film, beats, sort, knots
BLACK PANTHER	... it's a very rich buffet - geopolitical thriller, futuristic fantasy, coming-of-age story, African adventure with mystical overtones... it offers a wide variety of tastes and sensations but they never really come together to form a satisfying whole.	70	neutral	rich buffet, geopolitical thriller, futuristic fantasy, age story, African adventure, mystical overtones, wide variety, satisfying whole, tastes, sensations
BLACK PANTHER	What's the problem? Well, there's way too much expository dialogue and there are too many turgid flashbacks...the hand-to-hand fighting and battle sequences are now so formulaic and predictable in Marvel films that the adrenaline just doesn't kick in.	40	neutral	many turgid flashbacks, expository dialogue, hand fighting, battle sequences, Marvel films, problem, adrenaline
BLACK PANTHER	This version of Black Panther weaves a seemingly disparate set of strands together rather seamlessly, presenting more than enough comic book acrobatics and mayhem to satisfy the core fan base while also speaking a necessary degree of truth to power.	94	negative	enough comic book acrobatics, core fan base, Black Panther, disparate set, necessary degree, version, strands, mayhem, truth, power
BLACK PANTHER	Forget a lethal presidential Twitter account, King T'Challa has drank some kind of tea made from a Heart-Shaped Herb enabling him to take on an army. Black Panther pulls the right emotional levers focusing on the theme of the forgotten and the lost.	70	neutral	lethal presidential Twitter account, King T'Challa, right emotional levers, Heart-Shaped Herb, Black Panther, kind, tea, army, theme
BLACK PANTHER	Other Marvel movies have been rightfully dinged for weak villains, generic scores, visual sameness and superficial themes. The first megabudgeted superhero movie written by, directed by and largely starring black people just found what was missing.	94	negative	first megabudgeted superhero movie, Other Marvel movies, weak villains, generic scores, visual sameness, superficial themes, black people
BLACK PANTHER	What you don't expect from Marvel is a thoughtful story steeped in political parallels and the historical baggage of racial discrimination and suffering. That's what makes Black Panther unique among a teeming movie universe of extraordinary beings.	70	negative	teeming movie universe, thoughtful story, political parallels, historical baggage, racial discrimination, Black Panther, extraordinary beings, Marvel, suffering
CAPTAIN MARVEL	The film may be about women breaking their shackles, but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture. Humor winds up being provided by Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury, heart by Lashana Lynch's Maria Rambeau, and pathos by...well, it ain't Larson	20	neutral	lead actress, Samuel Jackson, Nick Fury, Lashana Lynch, Maria Rambeau, film, women, shackles, check, picture, Humor, heart, pathos, Larson
CAPTAIN MARVEL	Women and fans of female heroes deserved better than Captain Marvel (a mediocre entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) but there's no denying that it's rousing to see a woman triumph within the context of this heretofore excessively masculine universe.	69	positive	Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel, masculine universe, female heroes, mediocre entry, woman triumph, Women, fans, denying, context
CAPTAIN MARVEL	The strong lead and the fun, nostalgic-but-not-too-nostalgic vibe floats the movie through some iffy direction and an underutilized supporting cast. This is a good launching point for something that will hopefully be great when it's all said and done.	84	positive	good launching point, strong lead, nostalgic vibe, iffy direction, supporting cast, movie, something
CAPTAIN MARVEL	This film pulls off the impressive feat of making an origin story interesting by upending the usual structure of these tales, throwing us headlong into the action with the title heroine and only then revealing how she became an intergalactic warrior.	87	positive	impressive feat, origin story, usual structure, title heroine, intergalactic warrior, film, tales, action
CAPTAIN MARVEL	Captain Marvel is an unremarkable, passable time killer...[Brie] Larson's performance is wooden...while the film's big action scenes are so lacking in imagination the screen often looks as though it's being continually doused in technicolour vomit.	40	negative	unremarkable, passable time killer, big action scenes, Captain Marvel, technicolour vomit, Larson, performance, film, imagination, screen
CAPTAIN MARVEL	This is a new kind of female superhero, one who is fully comfortable in her own skin -- a funny, casual, wise cracking, cocky superhero. She's not overly serious, stiff, formal, or straining under destiny's weight. Instead, she's just fun to watch.	79	positive	new kind, female superhero, cocky superhero, skin, destiny, weight
CAPTAIN MARVEL	Samuel L. Jackson provides 99 percent of the chuckles here, but then, he does that in just about any movie he's in. Why is this movie suddenly a financial blockbuster? The only blockbuster-ness it warrants is the one Captain Marvel crash-lands in.	50	neutral	one Captain Marvel crash, Samuel L. Jackson, financial blockbuster, 99 percent, chuckles, movie, blockbuster-ness, lands
CAPTAIN MARVEL	Ignore those imbecilic MRAs, frightened fanboys, and all other insecure man-babies shellacked in misogyny: The truth is that this film is reams of fun and, significantly, no different in quality from past solo superhero flicks produced by Marvel.	75	negative	past solo superhero flicks, other insecure man-babies, imbecilic MRAs, fanboys, misogyny, truth, film, reams, fun, quality, Marvel
DUNE	Villeneuve's #DUNE is a visual triumph with committed performances, hampered only by narrative that by its prophetic nature is predictable. Zimmer's score is a fascinating ethnographically diverse blend, and fans of book should be thrilled with its scope.	84	positive	fascinating ethnographically diverse blend, visual triumph, committed performances, prophetic nature, Villeneuve, narrative, Zimmer, score, fans, book, scope
DUNE	An ambitious, contemplative sci-fi epic which could end up being regarded as Villeneuve's most monumental accomplishment. It may not be for everyone, but for those who do find themselves fully immersed in this world, a sublime cinematic experience awaits.	100	positive	ambitious, contemplative sci-fi epic, sublime cinematic experience, monumental accomplishment, Villeneuve, everyone, world
DUNE	Ultimately, the biggest issue is that it is narratively incomplete. It is all exposition and worldbuilding with some cool fight scenes, but it is all leading to something we don't see in this film and might not get to see if the sequel doesn't get made.	60	negative	cool fight scenes, biggest issue, exposition, worldbuilding, something, film, sequel
DUNE	Mesmerizing for much of its 3-hour length - especially during its first half, when it prioritizes statecraft and intrigue and augurs and artful arrangements of strangely costumed individuals and strikingly designed alien vessels over fights and chases.	87	positive	3-hour length, first half, artful arrangements, costumed individuals, alien vessels, statecraft, intrigue, augurs, fights, chases
DUNE	The first line in Dune is: Dreams are messages from the deep. It is part warning, part invitation. Don't be afraid. Fear is the mind killer. (If you don't get that reference then it applies to you even more.) Open your eyes, and let the dream take you.	90	neutral	first line, part warning, part invitation, mind killer, Dune, Dreams, messages, deep, Fear, reference, eyes
DUNE	Despite all the incredible eye candy on display, Villeneuve never loses sight of his characters. He makes Herbert's story all the more grounded and relatable by treating it as a coming-of-age film about a teenager trying to find his place in the world.	75	positive	incredible eye candy, age film, display, Villeneuve, sight, characters, Herbert, story, teenager, place, world
DUNE	With Villenueve at the front of it, the Dune saga has the potential to become the next LOTR. Since The Fellowship of the Ring there hasn't been a film that better introduces a universe as this one does. Villeneuve is a master. [Full review in Spanish]	90	neutral	Dune saga, next LOTR, The Fellowship, Full review, Villenueve, front, potential, Ring, film, universe, one, Villeneuve, master, Spanish
DUNE	Perhaps the cleverest thing of all about Dune is how Villeneuve and his co-writers manage to make Frank Herbert's intricate and convoluted story so crystal clear, and easy to follow. This first Dune is quite something: the sequel might be even better.	100	positive	cleverest thing, Frank Herbert, convoluted story, first Dune, Villeneuve, writers, intricate, something, sequel
DUNKIRK	A film that vindicates the struggle of the anonymous heroes, solidarity, and highlights the importance of not giving up in the most adverse moments, where everything seems to be lost. A very necessary message for the times we live [Full review in Spanish]	100	neutral	anonymous heroes, adverse moments, necessary message, Full review, film, struggle, solidarity, importance, everything, times, Spanish
DUNKIRK	Dunkirk may be [Nolan's] first historically based fiction, but it's his latest in a long line of survival puzzles, designed to thrill and to provoke the response moviemakers of all kinds have been after for more than a century: whew! Followed by: wow.	75	positive	long line, survival puzzles, response moviemakers, a century, Dunkirk, Nolan, fiction, kinds
DUNKIRK	The Oscar race for Best Picture is officially on. From first frame to last, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is a monumental achievement, a World War II epic of staggering visual spectacle (see it in IMAX if you can) that hits you like a shot in the heart.	100	neutral	World War II epic, The Oscar race, staggering visual spectacle, Best Picture, first frame, Christopher Nolan, monumental achievement, Dunkirk, IMAX, shot, heart
DUNKIRK	I'd go so far to say that Dunkirk could easily serve as its own master class in the art of film editing. Add to that an absolutely terrifyingly discordant score from Hans Zimmer and the result is, well, a bona fide classic. Well done, sir, well done.	90	neutral	bona fide classic, master class, film editing, discordant score, Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk, art, result
DUNKIRK	With a minimal but very memorable score from Hans Zimmer pulsating throughout, Nolan has crafted a film that captures the brutality of battle and the fears of these people who were fighting for their survival -- as well as their respective countries.	94	negative	memorable score, Hans Zimmer, respective countries, minimal, Nolan, film, brutality, battle, fears, people, survival
DUNKIRK	From the artful cinematography to Hans Zimmer's disorienting score, and the non-linear narrative to the dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk is a practice in the bursting through the boundaries of filmmaking. But it's more than the craft. It has heart.	100	negative	artful cinematography, Hans Zimmer, disorienting score, non-linear narrative, dialogue-less emotion, Dunkirk, practice, boundaries, filmmaking, craft, heart
DUNKIRK	A good movie that fails to capture the mind-boggling scope of almost 400,000 troops stranded on the beach and almost 1,000 boats crossing back and forth across the Channel to save them. There isn't even a crawl at the end to give the statistics.	90	positive	good movie, mind-boggling scope, 400,000 troops, beach, 1,000 boats, Channel, crawl, end, statistics
DUNKIRK	Each setting features its own editing rhythm, characters and score... Far from being a Memento-like puzzle to piece together, Dunkirk is a series of tense standoffs whose resolutions all funnel into the same prerequisite; get the soldiers home.	100	neutral	editing rhythm, Memento-like puzzle, tense standoffs, same prerequisite, setting, characters, score, Dunkirk, series, resolutions, soldiers
DUNKIRK	Dunkirk is a return to true form for director Christopher Nolan and it may very well be his best film yet. It combines the clever structure of Memento, the scale and ambition of The Dark Knight and the incredible cinematography of Inception.	100	positive	director Christopher Nolan, The Dark Knight, true form, best film, clever structure, incredible cinematography, Dunkirk, return, Memento, scale, ambition, Inception
FIRST MAN	Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong captures the all-business, single-mindedness of the man, as well as his emotional impassiveness. ... And while this may be an accurate portrait ... it does not afford the audience the opportunity to fully embrace him.	75	negative	Ryan Gosling, business, single-mindedness, emotional impassiveness, accurate portrait, portrayal, Armstrong, man, audience, opportunity
FIRST MAN	Mourning, grief, solitude... Gosling goes deeper into his incarnation of the charismatic mask: the Gary Cooper face that is still, sometimes stock-still, yet always a fraction of a hair from bleakest melancholy. Gosling's expression in a word: bereft.	100	negative	Gary Cooper face, charismatic mask, bleakest melancholy, Mourning, grief, solitude, Gosling, incarnation, fraction, hair, expression, word
FIRST MAN	For better and for worse, First Man feels like a close cousin to Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, another film that masterfully reproduced the sights and sounds of a world-shaking event. The people involved, though, don't come quite as vividly to life.	75	negative	First Man, close cousin, Christopher Nolan, world-shaking event, Dunkirk, film, sights, sounds, people, life
FIRST MAN	Like the best cinematic space odysseys that have come before, First Man brings with it a message of humanism and mortality that puts life into perspective. What better backdrop to experience an existential awakening than soaring across the cosmos?	84	positive	best cinematic space odysseys, First Man, existential awakening, message, humanism, mortality, life, perspective, backdrop, cosmos
FIRST MAN	Chazelle has done it again, delivering one of the finest space films ever made by focusing on the everyday humanism of our reluctant heroes rather than flag-waving cliches, thus cementing his place on the forefront of the next frontier of cinema.	100	positive	finest space films, everyday humanism, reluctant heroes, waving cliches, next frontier, Chazelle, flag, place, forefront, cinema
FIRST MAN	First Man is a stunning cinematic achievement that celebrates one of humanity's biggest triumphs (and mourns the tragedies that happened leading up to it), yet it never loses sight of its personal and small-scale story about a man going to work.	93	positive	stunning cinematic achievement, biggest triumphs, small-scale story, First Man, humanity, tragedies, sight, personal
FIRST MAN	There's more interesting and dramatic material orbiting Neil Armstrong. But those characters remain on the margins while Chazelle (as he did in Whiplash and La La Land) privileges the story of a single-minded white male reaching for the stars.	75	positive	La La Land, single-minded white male, dramatic material, Neil Armstrong, interesting, characters, margins, Chazelle, Whiplash, story, stars
JOKER	'Joker' is a film that is simply trying to elicit a response and provoke viewers. It is not what you will be expecting from a big-budget movie with a DC logo slapped on it. How Phillips made something that is on par with 'Taxi Driver' is utterly shocking.	90	neutral	big-budget movie, DC logo, Taxi Driver, Joker, film, response, viewers, Phillips, something, par
JOKER	For just over two hours we are forced into alignment with a monster. And, not only that, it wants us to unrepentantly side with him. It feels hyperbolic to say that this results in a terrible sense of inescapable unease when watching, but it's the truth.	40	negative	two hours, terrible sense, inescapable unease, alignment, monster, truth
JOKER	Whether it's worth seeing depends on your tolerance for glorifying a dangerous mentally ill man breaking bad and becoming a menace to the society that abandoned him. Yup, the joke's on us - all of us. And it's a message pounded home with a sledgehammer.	79	neutral	dangerous mentally ill man, tolerance, menace, society, Yup, joke, message, sledgehammer
JOKER	For what it is, it's gorgeously assembled, with a ragged jewel of a performance by Joaquin Phoenix at its center. The problem is, well, what it is... Joker ends up repeating itself and lap-dancing its same handful of nihilistic points again and again.	40	positive	ragged jewel, Joaquin Phoenix, same handful, nihilistic points, performance, center, problem, Joker
JOKER	Consciously channelling classics such as Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, it's a visually striking, breathtakingly dangerous reflection of our broken times wherein a deluded loner finally finds himself empowered and noticed when he picks up a gun.	100	negative	breathtakingly dangerous reflection, Taxi Driver, The King, broken times, deluded loner, classics, Comedy, gun
JOKER	Arthur Fleck's transformation to the enigmatic Joker ends up being a bucket of ice water for the viewer. Because what we see on the screen is no longer part of a fictional universe and instead becomes a reflection of reality. [Full Review in Spanish]	100	neutral	Arthur Fleck, enigmatic Joker, ice water, fictional universe, Full Review, transformation, bucket, viewer, screen, part, reflection, reality, Spanish
JOKER	There's... a strong sense that Phillips is brandishing this bleakness as a kind of affect, like the rich kid who wears his brand new black leather jacket to a punk show but only after intentionally scuffing it against the grill of his Bentley first.	83	neutral	brand new black leather jacket, strong sense, rich kid, punk show, Phillips, bleakness, kind, affect, grill, Bentley
JOKER	The theatrical trailer for Joker -- tight, controlled, and intriguing -- suggested the best movie Martin Scorsese never made. The actual movie is a shallow and sophomoric effort that isn't about a raging bull as much as it's merely raging bulls***.	50	positive	theatrical trailer, best movie, Martin Scorsese, actual movie, sophomoric effort, raging bull, Joker, shallow
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Bayona's direction is so stylish and confident that he's able to paper over the movie's narrative flaws and make for an engrossing experience that feels at times like a classic Jurassic movie and at others like a gothic horror movie in the Del Toro mould.	79	positive	Del Toro mould, classic Jurassic movie, gothic horror movie, narrative flaws, engrossing experience, Bayona, direction, times, others
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Fallen Kingdom is stately to the point of reserved; immensely weird; and overtly critical of the current state of affairs. I'm not sure it's a good dinosaur movie, but it's an angry, swollen-red metaphor. All things being equal, I guess I'll take angry.	75	neutral	good dinosaur movie, angry, swollen-red metaphor, Fallen Kingdom, current state, point, affairs, things
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Darkly moving (I never thought I'd weep for a diplodocus). The franchise can't go forward, its eternal weakness - but Bayona mixes it up with meta wit and verve. Goldblum is an occasional, iconic presence; I almost believed the cod-philosophy he spouts.	70	neutral	occasional, iconic presence, eternal weakness, meta wit, diplodocus, franchise, Bayona, verve, Goldblum, cod-philosophy
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Perhaps this franchise is simply at the stage of breeding where the pedigree starts to fade, you know the pets are going to get debilitating hip dysplasia after a few years, and yet you just press on anyway because you simply cannot do anything else.	30	negative	debilitating hip dysplasia, franchise, stage, breeding, pedigree, pets, years
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Fallen Kingdom is cheesy, predictable, but entertaining. It's one of those movies that you'll enjoy if you don't bother thinking about things during the movie. I can't even call it a bad movie because it does have a good mix of entertaining moments.	60	positive	Fallen Kingdom, good mix, entertaining moments, movies, things
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Bayona's take on the Jurassic Park franchise is an over the top mixture of gothic horror, nostalgia and Crichton's genetic preoccupations. It's undoubtedly interesting, but it fails short to accomplish all of its ambitions. [Full review in Spanish]	70	neutral	Jurassic Park franchise, top mixture, gothic horror, genetic preoccupations, Full review, Bayona, take, nostalgia, Crichton, ambitions, Spanish
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	This 'World' of incredibly silly dialogue, dumb villains and absurd plot points deserves to follow the B-movie dinosaurs that dominate to complete and total extinction. But, don't count on it: The next 'Jurassic' already has a 2021 opening date.	40	negative	absurd plot points, silly dialogue, dumb villains, B-movie dinosaurs, total extinction, 2021 opening date, World, Jurassic
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom makes a few slight improvements over the first film, including injecting the franchise with a little originality, but quickly finds itself becoming another tedious entry with its static center and elongated climax.	50	negative	Jurassic World, Fallen Kingdom, slight improvements, first film, little originality, tedious entry, static center, elongated climax, franchise
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Sequel to the 2015 franchise revival wastes its stars and feels like a T. Rex-sized cashgrab. Why cast Pratt, that rare movie star with a comic's sense of mischief, and then reduce him to a pawn who runs around hitting his marks like a robot?	50	negative	T. Rex-sized cashgrab, rare movie star, 2015 franchise revival, Sequel, stars, Pratt, comic, sense, mischief, pawn, marks, robot
JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM	Fallen Kingdom clears the extraordinarily low bar of being better made than its predecessor, but screenwriter and executive producer Colin Trevorrow crafts a follow-up to his own capital-b bad film with a story that's even broader and dumber.	40	negative	capital-b bad film, Fallen Kingdom, low bar, executive producer, Colin Trevorrow, predecessor, screenwriter, follow-up, story
KNIVES OUT	Filmmaker Rian Johnson knows Agatha Christie's oeuvre so well that he's able to honor it and screw with it too, ripping apart its pieces, moving them around, and making the hoary conventions of the procedural genre feel almost completely fresh and vital.	100	negative	Filmmaker Rian Johnson, Agatha Christie, hoary conventions, procedural genre, oeuvre, pieces
KNIVES OUT	[C]inematic legerdemain as its cast expertly calibrate their performances so that arch never strays into the certain disaster of becoming artificial.

KNIVES OUT	What's that I hear? It's 'as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced.'

KNIVES OUT	With a huge ensemble of A-list talent, a razor-sharp screenplay and a head-spinning number of shocks and surprises, Johnson adheres to genre conventions while simultaneously spinning them into something more complex, more devious, and more hilarious.	90	positive	huge ensemble, A-list talent, razor-sharp screenplay, head-spinning number, genre conventions, shocks, surprises, Johnson, something
KNIVES OUT	[Rian] Johnson has constructed a tightly plotted, superbly acted escape room for both his characters and the audience to explore and puzzle over. Most will find the two hours and 10 minutes it takes to solve well worth the price of admission.	88	neutral	escape room, two hours, Rian, Johnson, characters, audience, Most, 10 minutes, price, admission
KNIVES OUT	Knives Out does go on a bit longer and there are one too many running down corridors and driving from one place to another, but as a whole the film pays off with humor, mayhem, and shows us families to whom entitlement is their middle name.	60	negative	one place, middle name, Knives, corridors, film, humor, mayhem, families, entitlement
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT	Cruise's dynamic with Cavill is one of the film's highlights, making you think this is The Man From U.N.C.L.E. movie that should have been made...Fallout is an improvement on all the previous film's failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them.	100	positive	U.N.C.L.E. movie, The Man, best aspects, previous film, Cruise, dynamic, Cavill, highlights, Fallout, improvement, failings
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT	An action movie masterpiece, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is nothing short of incredible and an absolute must-see.

MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT	Self-important and impossibly troubling to anyone who remembers how Tom Cruise has (allegedly) treated women in real life, Fallout is ultimately a fun watch, even if it feels like an uncomfortably long kiss slurped on the lips of practical stuntwork.	74	negative	uncomfortably long kiss, Tom Cruise, real life, fun watch, practical stuntwork, women, Fallout, lips
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT	A near-perfect blend of old-school cliffhanger movie aesthetics with state of the art filmmaking technology...it joins Bourne, the Fast and the Furious, Transformers and the Dark Knight trilogy as a franchise setting the pace in the 21st century.	90	positive	old-school cliffhanger movie aesthetics, Dark Knight trilogy, perfect blend, filmmaking technology, 21st century, state, art, Bourne, Fast, Furious, Transformers, franchise, pace
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT	Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the sixth film of the series, and, quite possibly, the best.

Fallout is THAT good.	84	positive	Christopher McQuarrie, sixth film, Brad Bird, Ghost Protocol, new champ, Mission, Impossible, Fallout, series
MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT	It's got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it.	100	positive	great action film, great action performances, perfect blend, technical element, fantastic script, service, genre
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is as well-made and deliciously unhinged as any of Tarantino's films. But the impeccable recreation of 1969 Hollywood - from the sun-drenched cinematography to the lived-in costumes - isn't enough to keep a thin story afloat.	60	positive	impeccable recreation, sun-drenched cinematography, thin story, Time, Hollywood, Tarantino, films, costumes
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	Meandering but deliberate, gorgeous and garrulous, it is very much the writer-director doing what he does so well, but in very familiar fashion. Which brings up the possibility that in making a movie about movie making, his real subject here is himself.	60	positive	familiar fashion, real subject, movie making, writer-director, possibility
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	For much of the 161-minute film - which proceeds at a meandering pace that, while never uninteresting, offers solid evidence that no one today dares tell Tarantino no - I wrestled with a question that I never before had while watching a Q.T. joint: Why?	62	negative	Q.T. joint, 161-minute film, meandering pace, solid evidence, one, Tarantino, question
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a departure from Tarantino's flashier work, showing a more mature, contemplative side to the hyper cinephile. ... Leaving the theater, you'll wonder how history might have changed had this horrific murder not occurred.	87	neutral	mature, contemplative side, flashier work, hyper cinephile, horrific murder, Time, Hollywood, departure, Tarantino, theater, history
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	I think what Tarantino is going for is brazenly manipulating historical events to suit his style, and turning a well-worn genre on its head. But in so doing he's made an everything bagel of a movie: Part satire, part bear-hug, part fictional bromance.	50	negative	part fictional bromance, Part satire, part bear-hug, historical events, everything bagel, Tarantino, style, genre, head, movie
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	Quentin Tarantino personally drives me up a wall, but love him or hate him, QT's a cinematic fixture, guaranteed to be in the director Hall of Fame. I have to give credit where credit is due: Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is too long but very amusing.	70	positive	Quentin Tarantino, cinematic fixture, director Hall, wall, QT, Fame, credit, Time, Hollywood
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	A superb time at the movies, a languid, fun, exquisitely crafted movie movie that is best appreciated in the context of QT's whole career ... if this is your first Tarantino, you'll have a great time, but it needs to be your ninth for you to get it.	90	positive	languid, fun, exquisitely crafted movie movie, superb time, first Tarantino, great time, movies, context, QT, career
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	It's as self-indulgent as Tarantino has ever been, but at the same time very much still at the top of his game. The only downside being constantly pulled away form a main storyline by knowing a major tragedy could happen at any time right next door.	90	negative	main storyline, major tragedy, same time, Tarantino, top, game, downside
ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	Aside from slow pace of the movie, and the occasional long-winded speech, this is a movie that is fun to watch, mainly because of the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio (great performance) and because of the film's satisfying ending.	79	positive	occasional long-winded speech, slow pace, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, great performance, satisfying ending, movie, chemistry, film
READY PLAYER ONE	Approximately 15 parts fun escapism and one part reflection. In a culture that's obsessed with unearthing obscure references, it will be interesting to see how the movie's fans-and I think there will be many-process the conflicting messages, if at all.	62	positive	15 parts fun escapism, one part reflection, unearthing obscure references, conflicting messages, culture, movie, fans
READY PLAYER ONE	If the book is basically Fifty Shades of Grey for guys who have yet to discover their peckers, the film is a diverting slice of entertainment, offering enough surface thrills to justify its existence in a world already overloading on nostalgic feints.	75	positive	enough surface thrills, Fifty Shades, diverting slice, nostalgic feints, book, Grey, guys, peckers, film, entertainment, existence, world
READY PLAYER ONE	An ugly FX monstrosity that misunderstands the misguided message of the book & fails to address its antiquated notions of race, gender and capitalism. Abysmal fan service from Spielberg, who should be able to shoot and edit a climax better than this	30	negative	ugly FX monstrosity, Abysmal fan service, misguided message, antiquated notions, book, race, gender, capitalism, Spielberg, climax
READY PLAYER ONE	As you would expect from a Spielberg film, the production values are first rate, with great special effects and great visuals, especially the stunning way the digital world of Oasis appears. The acting, and of course the direction, are both solid.	79	positive	great special effects, great visuals, Spielberg film, production values, first rate, stunning way, digital world, Oasis, acting, course, direction
READY PLAYER ONE	Ready Player One is more like a seven-course banquet made up entirely of Pixie Stix and Pop Rocks-you certainly get a rush from it for a little while but once the initial effect, there is not much of anything else going for it but overindulgence.	60	negative	Ready Player, seven-course banquet, Pixie Stix, Pop Rocks, initial effect, rush
READY PLAYER ONE	For those looking for Ready Player One to condemn the digi-verse as a destructive force against human connection, find another movie.

Game on.	75	neutral	Ready Player, destructive force, human connection, mindbending joyride, head-spinning spectacle, sensory overload, digi-verse, movie, Spielberg, Game
READY PLAYER ONE	It does not exist to stretch your mind (it does stretch your time, running a bit too long in the third act) but like the OASIS, it's a wonderful piece of escapism. Sometimes, a vacation from anything meaningful does make for an interesting ride.	70	positive	third act, wonderful piece, interesting ride, mind, time, OASIS, escapism, vacation
READY PLAYER ONE	Frenetic and dense action sequences engage, but seldom thrill. And threats to the heroes' lives don't feel convincing...While Sheridan and Cooke create personable characters, they lack the sizzling chemistry needed to punch through the artifice.	62	positive	dense action sequences, heroes' lives, personable characters, sizzling chemistry, Frenetic, threats, Sheridan, Cooke, artifice
READY PLAYER ONE	Many of the book's references to Spielberg's cultural artifacts have been stripped away, but he imbibes the movie with flashes of colour and heart that rekindle a sense of wonderment that will transport many viewers back to their childhoods.	75	negative	many viewers back, cultural artifacts, book, references, Spielberg, movie, flashes, colour, heart, sense, wonderment, childhoods
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	A highly entertaining mess...the kind of loopy, stumblebum spectacle you get when state-of-the-art visual effects collide head-on with the erratic sensibilities of a resolutely mediocre director and the crushing need for a studio to meet a release date.	60	positive	loopy, stumblebum spectacle, art visual effects, entertaining mess, erratic sensibilities, mediocre director, crushing need, release date, kind, state, studio
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	In the first 'Star Wars' film, in 1977, heroism is rewarded (literally, in the form of a medal); but here, heroism requires extreme sacrifice. That (ultimately lethal) distinction is a key to the difference between previous chapters and this sidebar...	87	positive	first 'Star Wars' film, extreme sacrifice, lethal) distinction, previous chapters, heroism, form, medal, key, difference, sidebar
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	Rogue One: A Star Wars Story has gorgeous visuals, including an excellent production design and great special effects, but when it comes to the narrative, there's a lot left to be desired thanks to a screenplay that refuses to develop the characters.	50	negative	A Star Wars Story, excellent production design, great special effects, Rogue One, gorgeous visuals, narrative, lot, screenplay, characters
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	Gareth Edwards' venture into a galaxy far, far away is the Star Wars film we never knew we needed. It's a triumphantly thrilling, serious-minded war movie that is incalculably stronger for the fact that it's NOT the first chapter in a new franchise.	88	neutral	thrilling, serious-minded war movie, Star Wars film, Gareth Edwards, first chapter, new franchise, galaxy, fact
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	For those who grew up loving Star Wars, but have wanted the film series to grow up and become more nuanced and dangerous along with them, Rogue One does this, while still squarely existing within the design and narrative parameters of the universe.	84	negative	Star Wars, film series, Rogue One, narrative parameters, design, universe
ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	Its much more than a simple spin-off, is one of the highest chapters of the entire saga.

ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	These Star Wars movies are pretty much the same story each time nowadays.

ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	The performances in this film are among the best the franchise has seen. This isn't a film of supermen.

ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY	Those with patience will find that its second half is fully rewarding, with its epic battles and grand conflicts between good and evil bearing most of the weight of the astronomical expectations that are now part and parcel of the franchise.	75	negative	second half, epic battles, grand conflicts, astronomical expectations, patience, good, evil, weight, part, parcel, franchise
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	The picture is zippy enough to almost earn a recommendation.

SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	Solo is not good because it was supposed to suck. It's good because a profoundly fun cast delivered a goofy pulp sci-fi adventure. It could have actually been great if only it wasn't obsessed with fansplaining details literally nobody was curious about.	84	negative	goofy pulp sci-fi adventure, fun cast, Solo, fansplaining, details
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	The action is surprisingly disappointing. Most of the blockbuster moments feature so many fast cuts that there is none of the epic quality that is a mainstay of the franchise. With no tension or sense of menace these scenes drag rather than exhilarate.	40	negative	many fast cuts, blockbuster moments, epic quality, action, none, mainstay, franchise, tension, sense, menace, scenes
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	Solo is technically a Star Wars movie, but it's one that has set pieces in place of a personality. It's a film whose base level is fine. Despite some unique cinematography, Ron Howard's direction is staid, stolid, and completely without personality.	64	neutral	Star Wars movie, base level, unique cinematography, Ron Howard, Solo, pieces, place, personality, film, direction
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	The first act is glacial, the extended universe connections weak and the entire concept and execution of L3 abysmal.

SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	Considering its production history and the fact that most origin films are inherently blasé, Solo acquits itself quite nicely. Maybe it doesn't add a great deal to the mythology, but for fans of the space western genre, it's solid entertainment.	79	neutral	most origin films, space western genre, production history, great deal, solid entertainment, fact, Solo, mythology, fans
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	It's a rite-of-passage movie about what it takes this free spirited rebel - a reckless kid more concerned with impressing a girl rather than igniting the spark that will eventually fuel the rebellion - to become the character we know and love.	70	negative	free spirited rebel, passage movie, reckless kid, girl, spark, rebellion, character
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	Young Han can only watch helplessly as the gravity of the Star Wars children's crusade overwhelms him and the wondrous fun run gives way to a joyless slog that actually undermines the heroism of A New Hope even as it seeks to foreshadow it.	20	negative	Star Wars children, wondrous fun run, A New Hope, Young Han, joyless slog, gravity, crusade, way, heroism
SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY	This popcorn Star Wars prequel is light, funny and entertaining for the most part, unlike the previous, heavy, serious, tragic prequel, 'Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,' but nevertheless, it seems pretty sleight, with thin characterizations.	69	positive	previous, heavy, serious, tragic prequel, popcorn Star Wars prequel, A Star Wars Story, most part, Rogue One, thin characterizations
SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	Watching Spidey get Laffy Taffy-ed between responsibility and his own desires is the best version of the character.

Happiness, Spidey, responsibility, desires, character, universality, boulder
SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	That's a lot of supers, but unfortunately none of them apply to the plot, which is way too complex for its own good and involves an awful lot of trickery and illusion, including the illusion that this film is a worthy successor to Spider-Man: Homecoming.	60	negative	worthy successor, awful lot, supers, none, plot, good, trickery, illusion, film, Spider-Man, Homecoming
SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	This Spidey flick is about young, geek love to the max, all of which can be summed up by that favorite millennial word: Awkward!

SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	Far From Home is really just a sweet teenage romance wrapped in a big-budget superhero package.

SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	Everything about the follow-up to the delightful 2017 Spider-Man: Homecoming lives up to the web-slinger's friendly moniker, delivering an incredibly fun, frequently funny, and sweet sojourn from the soul-crushing grief of April's Avengers: Endgame.	75	positive	delightful 2017 Spider-Man, friendly moniker, sweet sojourn, soul-crushing grief, Everything, follow, up, Homecoming, web-slinger, fun, April, Avengers, Endgame
SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	The main thrust of the story is Peter's journey of self-discovery.

SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	Tom Holland cements his place as the best actor to portray Spider-Man in Far From Home.

SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME	Those who have seen Endgame should be ready for a major change of pace. It's like eating a huge steak for dinner and then being offered a cup of vanilla pudding for dessert.

STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS	This seventh movie is a humongous piece of cinema -- all that a sequel should be and more: a nostalgic homage to the 1977 original, coupled with intergalactic, warp-speed, panoramic blockbuster action, and a new heroine in the form of Daisy Ridley's Rey.	100	positive	intergalactic, warp-speed, panoramic blockbuster action, seventh movie, humongous piece, nostalgic homage, new heroine, Daisy Ridley, cinema, sequel, 1977 original, form, Rey
STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS	[The film] is a state-of-the-art throwback, both retro and post-modern in its self-awareness. It doesn't just know that it's operating in the long shadow of a classic; it hardwires that understanding into its own DNA, making legacy a prevailing theme.	84	neutral	art throwback, long shadow, prevailing theme, film, state, self, awareness, classic, understanding, DNA, legacy

STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS	The nostalgic callbacks are so insistent that they can stop the narrative dead, like when some real drama is about to go down but everything pauses so we can have a meet-cute with C-3PO.

STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS	'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' easily lives up to its mammoth hype, but it's not flawless, nor a better film than the original trilogy.

STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS	As a one-off, the movie might seem like a little miracle - a fresh take on nostalgia not too different in tone from last year's delightful Turbo Kid.

STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI	It's all watchable to those of us in the Skeptics Tribe.

STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI	Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight.	100	positive	a half hours, dazzling use, action sequences, color, comedy, film, guy, eyes, everything, fool, two

STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER	The pacing in the first act leaves something to be desired but at the end of the day, the joy I felt watching this beloved story come to its conclusion could not be diminished.

STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER	Not so much a continuation, but a tangent, an almost complete erasure of the bold choices made by Rian Johnson which dared to expand the series' horizons, but Abrams has never been able to resist the dark power of the nostalgia.

STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER	Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a lot of fun, a genuine achievement and a great way to spend a couple of hours at the theater...

STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER	OK, the final episode isn't perfect. You'll nitpick it forever with your friends. But that's the point. Star Wars isn't a movie, it's family. We're that close to it.

STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER	Neither the best nor the worst of the Star Wars franchise...And don't shed too many tears.

TOY STORY 4	It doesn't put you through the emotional wringer the way its predecessor did, but it's consistently inventive, funny, witty, and heartfelt.

TOY STORY 4	Toy Story 4 is exceptional on so many levels. Non-stop laughs, jaw-dropping animation, and an especially touching chapter of Woody's journey.

TOY STORY 4	Although undoubtedly pleasant, it seems to have a thesis that life is about moving on and not repeating behaviors out of fear.

TOY STORY 4	Toy Story 4 is a wonderful film and proof positive that a sequel -- a third sequel, no less -- can be just as strong and smart and surprising as the work that it sprang from, provided that it has been made with the same degree of care and ambition.	100	positive	Toy Story, wonderful film, same degree, third sequel, proof, work, care, ambition
TOY STORY 4	Toy Story 4 is a wonderful film and a beautiful (maybe?) send-off for these characters.

TOY STORY 4	While the novelty will never be the same as it was the first time 24 years ago, curiosity and invention continue to be displayed in full force in the Toy Story movies. How's this for praise: I left smiling. And that really counts, sometimes.	84	negative	Toy Story movies, first time, full force, novelty, curiosity, invention, praise
TOY STORY 4	Enjoyable and energetic but hardly essential, this is a piece you could pluck from the Toy Story canon and never notice its absence. That's a far cry from the ways in which this franchise has always challenged itself to reach for the sky.	70	positive	Toy Story canon, piece, absence, far, ways, franchise, sky
US	Ambition in the horror genre can be a good thing, but the overreach in this movie detracts from both the horror and the ambition.

US	After a thrilling 100 minutes, Peele's ambitions do get the best of him - he can't quite close it out and the film's messy final 15 minutes feel overtly expository. Alas, it turns out that Us, quite ironically, is also confused about its own identity.	79	negative	messy final 15 minutes, thrilling 100 minutes, Peele, ambitions, film, Us, identity

US	Writer-director Jordan Peele's followup to the epochal 'Get Out' is as messy and overstuffed as its predecessor was direct and elegant.

1917	The use of a camera seamlessly following two men through the trenches, barbed wire, and horrors of No Man's Land is a sight we didn't know we needed to see. We need to see it.

FIRST MAN	While it celebrates the struggle and technological marvel that was Apollo 11 without resorting to empty histrionics, it's also a well-wrought character study of a man whose tight-lipped demeanor belied the emotional turmoil roiling beneath the surface.	80	negative	technological marvel, character study, lipped demeanor, emotional turmoil, struggle, Apollo, histrionics, man, tight, surface
FIRST MAN	It's no wonder that [Damien] Chazelle loves portraying obsessed men because he is clearly obsessed with the details. He pays attention to everything.

JOKER	Gritty and grubby, garish and loud, violent and depressing, Joker is a blunt instrument of a movie - though it is a good movie.

ONCE UPON A TIME... IN HOLLYWOOD	[It] isn't the masterpiece that some are claiming; it's too rambling, self-indulgent and - despite a typically grand guignol ending - anti-climactic for that.
